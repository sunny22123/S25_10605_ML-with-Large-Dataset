## Machine Learning with Large Datasets

This repository contains my homework assignments and projects for the course **Machine Learning with Large Datasets (10-605)** at Carnegie Mellon University. The course focuses on the challenges of working with large-scale data and introduces practical and theoretical techniques for machine learning at scale.

## Course Overview

Large datasets pose challenges throughout the machine learning pipeline. These challenges include visualization difficulties, computational and storage bottlenecks during data preprocessing and model training, and issues with inference in high-capacity models. 

This course covers:
- Data cleaning, visualization, and preprocessing at scale
- Principles of parallel and distributed computing for machine learning
- Scalable deep learning techniques
- Memory, computation, and communication complexity analysis
- Methods for low-latency inference
